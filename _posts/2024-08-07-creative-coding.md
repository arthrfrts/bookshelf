A heavily modified version of the classic 1980s video game _[Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_\(video_game\))_ produces visually interesting glitches.

**Creative coding** is a type of [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. It is used to create live visuals and for [VJing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VJing), as well as creating visual art and design, entertainment (e.g. [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game)), art installations, projections and [projection mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping), sound art, advertising, product [prototypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype), and much more.

Using programming to create art is a practice that started in the 1960s. In later decades groups such as Compos 68[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding#cite_note-1) successfully explored programming for artistic purposes, having their work exhibited in international exhibitions. From the 80s onward expert programmers joined the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), and tested their skills against each other by creating "demos": highly technically competent visual creations.

Recent exhibitions and books, including Dominic Lopes' _A Philosophy of Computer Art_ (2009) have sought to examine the integral role of coding in contemporary art beyond that of Human Computer Interface (HCI).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding#cite_note-2) Criticising Lopes however, Juliff and Cox argue that Lopes continues to privilege interface and user at the expense of the integral condition of code in much computer art. Arguing for a more nuanced appreciation of coding, Juliff and Cox set out contemporary creative coding as the examination of code and intentionality as integral to the users understanding of the work.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding#cite_note-3)

Currently there is a renewed interest in the question why programming as a method of producing art hasn't flourished. [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) has renewed interest with their Dev Art initiative,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding#cite_note-4) but this in turn has elicited strong reactions from a number of creative coders who claim that coining a new term to describe their practice is counterproductive.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding#cite_note-hacktheartworld-5)

Some contemporary artists who use creative coding in their work are [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman), [Zachary Lieberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Lieberman), [Golan Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Levin), [Ben Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Fry), and [Giles Whitaker (artist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_Whitaker_\(artist\)).

Although any technology or programming language can potentially be used for creative purposes, certain [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_\(computing\)) and [frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) have been specifically crafted to aid in the rapid prototyping and development of creative works.
